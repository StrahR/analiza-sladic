Drain the raisins, and mix with the cinnamon and chopped bananas. Spoon some of the banana mixture onto half of each square, leaving at least 1/2 inch of dough exposed at the edge to seal the edges. Fold the dough over the fruit, and pinch the edges together. Make sure that they are secure.  I like to roll the excess dough up around the edges and then pinch it until it's thin again.  You'll want to have about a 1/2 inch closure in the end.  You can trim the edges a bit to make them more aesthetically pleasing. Place empanadas on a baking sheet.

First off, I'm a 22-year-old man and when I was in my teens, my great-grandmother, who I called Muz, would make sugar cookies all the time for me and my grandparents. They were phenomenal, as she had perfected it over the years. She passed at the young age of 95 in 2006 and left the recipe in one of her boxes. Now that I've been cooking, I found her recipe for her Drop Sugar Cookies last week and made them last night. They are awesome, but you'll learn that when you make them. Enjoy!\"",
