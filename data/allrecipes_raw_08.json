Place nuts, in a single layer, on an ungreased baking sheet.  (I like to use my round non-stick pizza pan because it has a lip on it which prevents the nuts from rolling off.)  Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, stirring halfway through baking time, or until nuts become fragrant and are lightly browned.  (Watch nuts closely to prevent burning.)  Cool nuts completely before chopping and adding to recipe.  (You can speed up the cooling process by immediately placing hot, toasted nuts onto a plate and place in the freezer for 5 to 8 minutes.  Halfway through chilling time, stir the nuts to aid the cooling process.)"
