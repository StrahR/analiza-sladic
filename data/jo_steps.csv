0,0,"Even though it has a strong British heritage, America has embraced the apple pie to the point that it’s now considered a quintessentially American dessert. American pies often look like the ones from those Desperate Dan comics – big, robust and full of attitude. The crumble-like topping sprinkled over my pie is an idea I’ve been playing about with, and I think it helps make it unique. Because huckleberries grow wild in Wyoming, I felt it was only right to use them, but feel free to use fresh or frozen blueberries in their place for equally delicious results. Assembling your pie is dead easy, and I’ll talk you through it step by step, but if you’d like to see how it’s done before you start, check out the How to video for a demonstration."
0,1,"You can make your pastry by hand, or simply pulse all the ingredients in a food processor. If making by hand, sieve the flour, icing sugar and a pinch of sea salt from a height into a large mixing bowl. Use your fingertips to gently work the cubes of butter into the flour and sugar until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Transfer a handful of this mixture to a separate bowl, rub it between your fingers to get larger crumbs, then put aside. Add the eggs and milk to the main mixture and gently work it together until you have a ball of pastry dough. Don’t work it too much at this stage – you want to keep it crumbly and short. Sprinkle a little flour over the pastry, then wrap it in cling film and pop it into the fridge to rest for 1 hour."
0,2,"Meanwhile, put the apples into a large pan with the zest and juice of 1 orange, a splash of water and 5 tablespoons of caster sugar. Cover the pan and simmer on a medium heat for 10 minutes, until the apples have softened but still hold their shape. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Scrunch a handful of berries in a bowl with the remaining caster sugar and the zest and juice of your remaining orange. Add the rest of the berries. Toss the cooled apples and their juices in a large bowl with the berries and the flour, then put aside."
0,3,"Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Take your ball of pastry out of the fridge and let it come up to room temperature. Get yourself a pie dish around 28cm in diameter. Flour a clean surface and a rolling pin. Cut off a third of your pastry and put that piece to one side. Roll the rest into a circle just over 0.5cm thick, dusting with flour as you go. Roll the circle of pastry up over your rolling pin, then gently unroll it over the pie dish. Push it into the sides, letting any excess pastry hang over the edge. Tip in the fruit filling and brush all around the edge of the pastry with some of the beaten egg. Roll out the smaller ball of pastry about 0.5cm thick and use your rolling pin to lay it over the top of the pie. Brush it all over with more beaten egg, reserving a little. Sprinkle over the reserved crumble mixture and the demerara sugar."
0,4,"Fold the scruffy edges of pastry hanging over the sides back over the pie, sealing the edge by twisting or crimping it as you like. Brush these folded edges with your remaining beaten egg. Using a small, sharp knife, cut a cross into the middle of the pie. Place on the bottom of the oven and bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until golden and beautiful. Serve with ice cream, cream or custard."
1,0,"Smush-ins are one of the coolest sweet treats to make. I remember when I was a kid, me and my sister would always try to defrost our hard ice-cream in our dessert bowls into almost a thick milkshakey consistency before scoffing the lot. Then as we matured we realised that many flavours could be mushed in to improve the flavour of the rubbishy ice-cream that our parents always used to give us."
1,1,"So, from the word ‘mush’ and the phrase ‘mushing it in’ they became ‘smush-ins’. It was great going round the supermarkets as a kid secretly slipping possible smush-ins into the trolley. Anything could be a contender – from maple syrup to bashed up chocolate bits, meringue, fruit – you name it, we would smush it! Winegums aren't so good though. But melted chocolate caramel bars are choooooooice."
1,2,"All you need to do is get a big pot of vanilla ice-cream and a selection of possible smush-ins. Take 2 large scoops of ice-cream per person, blob these on to a clean chopping board, sprinkle or dribble over your flavours and then, with a spatula or fork, mush and smush them together. Scoop up and lob into a bowl or cornet."
1,3,Give these a bash and make an event of them when you've got all the kids round. They're really good fun and great to use as bribes to get the kids helping you with the proper cooking! Smush away.

5,0,"When it comes to mulled wine, I have a simple rule: always make more than you think you’ll need. Whenever I go to a party it always seems to run out. If you’re worried about wasting any leftovers, don’t be. You can pour it into ice cube trays and it will keep for months if you freeze it. Then, whenever anyone says, “Oh I feel like dessert’ you can just pop some cubes out and make this lovely little sorbet for a totally unexpected treat. "
5,1,"There are only two things you need to remember when making your mulled wine into sorbet: firstly, you have to cook off all the alcohol if you want the wine to freeze. And secondly, it’s important to give the mulled wine plenty of time to freeze, as the cubes need to be very hard for this sorbet. "
5,2,"Bring your mulled wine to the boil, and keep it on a rolling boil for around 5 to 6 minutes so the mixture becomes syrupy and the alcohol burns off.  Let it cool completely then pour it into ice-cube trays and pop these in the freezer until you need them. "
5,3,"To make the sorbet, pop the cubes of frozen mulled wine into a food processor and give them one or two quick blitzes to break them down a little bit. Add your yoghurt or crème fraîche and whiz immediately until just blended. "
5,4,Spoon the sorbet into little bowls or cups and either pop these back in the freezer to set a bit or serve right away with a biscotti or some lovely fresh fruit on the side.

8,3,"Stir in 1 splash of milk to loosen the batter, then evenly divide it between the 2 cake tins. "
8,4,"Bake the cakes in the oven for 22 to 25 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. To test, insert a skewer into the middle of a cake; it’s ready when the skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tins for 5 minutes, then turn onto a wire rack to cool completely."
8,5,"Once completely cool, pour the cream into a large bowl, scrape in the vanilla seeds and whisk until you have soft peaks. "

11,0,"Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. In a food processor, blitz the sultanas, apricots, dates, baking powder and a little of the flour (just enough to stop the fruit sticking to the blades). If you don’t have a food processor, you can chop it very finely. Put this mixture into a bowl with the muscovado sugar, the golden syrup, the egg and the melted butter and stir together. Then add the very hot water and the remaining flour and mix well with a whisk. Divide the mixture between 12 cupcake papers (I like to double up the papers to give the mixture a bit more hold) and place on a baking tray. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes."

Mix the yoghurt and vinegar together in a bowl, then add to the mixture and beat for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the remaining cupcake ingredients and 1 teaspoon of fine sea salt, then whisk until smooth and just combined. Fill the paper cases two-thirds full with mixture, but don’t bother to smooth it out. Bake for 20 minutes, or until they spring back when touched. Leave to cool, transferring to a wire cooling rack after 5 minutes."
12,1,"Meanwhile, make the icing. Beat the soya spread with an electric mixer for 1 to 2 minutes, or until smooth. Sift the icing sugar into a large bowl, then add to the soya spread in two stages, beating well between each. Add the vanilla extract and a small splash of water, then whisk for a further few minutes, or until silky smooth – if it’s too stiff, add a splash more water to loosen.

16,10,"Keep beating until the mixture is smooth, glossy and comes away from the sides of the pan."

16,16,Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
16,17,"In a bowl, whip the double cream and Greek yoghurt until it holds firm peaks, then fold in the raspberry curd until it holds soft peaks – don’t over-fold as this will make it hard to pipe into the buns."

18,0,"This is a superb moist cake, a bit like a clafoutis in France, but by adding breadcrumbs and using polenta it becomes very much like an Italian bread and butter pudding. It’s something that Italians would cook in the embers of the fire after dinner."
18,1,"Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and butter a shallow 28cm loose-bottomed cake tin. Mix the polenta, flour, breadcrumbs and sugar in a large bowl.

Add the figs, raisins, apples, cinnamon, orange and lemon zest and salt, and stir again."
18,2,"Pour the mixture into your cake tin and bake for about 50 minutes. Keep an eye on it – you may need to cover it with some foil if you find that it starts to brown too much at the edges.

22,0,"When you halve the peaches, leave the stones in – they will come away a lot more easily after they have been cooked. Put them into a small pan with 4 tablespoons of the sugar, the cinnamon stick and the zest and juice of the orange. Put a lid on top and slowly simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, until the peach skin and stones can be easily removed. You don't want to cook them to pulp – they should be soft but should still hold their shape. Remove from the heat and put to one side."
22,1,"In an appropriately sized high-sided, thick-bottomed pan with a lid, slowly melt two-thirds of the butter. Score down the length of the vanilla pods and remove the seeds by scraping a knife down the inside of each half. Add the seeds to the butter and stir. Continue to cook for 1 minute before adding your rice with the remaining sugar. Turn the heat up to medium, stir the rice, and add the wine, continuing to stir until it has almost cooked away. Now add the milk little by little. Keep the rice on a slow but constant simmer for about 16 or 17 minutes and stir it as often as you can. In this way you can massage the starch out of the rice and this will give you a silky, oozy end product, much like the classic Italian risotto. When the rice has cooked through it should be soft yet still holding its shape. You may need to add a little more milk or water just to adjust the consistency. Remove from the heat, add the grated white chocolate and the rest of the butter, then stir, place a lid on top and leave for a few minutes."
22,2,"Remove the skin and stones from the peaches, discard them along with the cinnamon stick, and take the peaches to the table with your block of dark chocolate, snapped into small pieces. Spoon the risotto on to plates, then push a couple of pieces of dark chocolate into the middle of each one. Just so you know, a perfect risotto should slowly creep and ooze to the side of your plate, so don't worry if it starts to spread out! Gently tear the peaches and place some on each plate, then drizzle over some of the lovely juice and sprinkle over a few mint leaves. By the time you go to eat it, the dark chocolate will have melted. Joy joy joy!"
23,0,"Add the yoghurt and frozen fruit to a food processor and blitz until smooth, then finely chop and fold through most of the dried fruit, saving some to serve."

47,0,"Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Split the vanilla pods and remove the seeds. Put the seeds and pods into an appropriately sized casserole-type pan that will hold all your pears snugly, and add the wine, sugar, cinnamon, and orange juice and zest. Throw in your thyme, secured together in a little bunch with string. Bring to the boil, turn down to a simmer, and add your pears, sitting upright. Put the lid on the pan and bake in the preheated oven for around 1 hour until the pears are soft and tender but not falling apart. They should be soft all the way through but retain their shape. (Sometimes they can take less or more time depending on the ripeness of the pears.) When they're ready they will have taken on the flavour and colour of the wine and should smell delicious."
47,1,"By now the wine and the sugar will have thickened and the flavour will have intensified. Remove the pears to a dish, turn up the heat under the pan, and reduce the wine by about half. Remove from the heat and add the butter – agitate the pan but don't give it any more heat. This will give you a really intense, tasty sauce which is to die for. Put the pears back in the pan and leave until ready to serve. Warm is the best temperature to serve this dish, and it’s best with some nice whipped sour cream or crème fraîche – a lovely contrast to the richness of the sauce."
48,0,Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6.
48,1,"Peel and core the apples, then quarter and chop into 3cm chunks."
48,2,Place in a saucepan on a medium heat with 100g of sugar and a few fine gratings of lemon zest.
48,3,"Pop the lid on and cook for 5 minutes, or until the apples have softened. Remove the heat and leave to cool a little."
48,4,"Meanwhile, cube the butter and place in a mixing bowl with the flour. Rub together with your fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs, then scrunch in the remaining sugar to add a little texture."
48,5,Transfer the apples to a 25cm x 30cm baking dish and sprinkle over the crumble topping.
48,6,"Bake in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. Delicious served with vanilla custard."
49,0,"Stir the yeast into the warm milk in a bowl, then put it aside. If using cardamom pods, lightly bash them in a pestle and mortar, then pick out the husks and pound the seeds to a fine powder. Beat the eggs and a pinch of sea salt in a large bowl, then add the cardamom, sugar, melted butter, 500g of the flour and the milk and yeast mixture. Whisk constantly as you add everything so you end up with quite a thick, gluey consistency. Mix in the remaining 300g of flour until you have a dough. Use clean floured hands to bring the dough together, then dust the top with flour. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to prove for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size and is full of air pockets."
49,1,"Meanwhile, put the blueberries and caster sugar into a bowl. Finely grate the orange zest and add most of it to the bowl, along with a good squeeze of orange juice, then mash together with a potato masher. Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper, then dot the paper with a few knobs of the butter and sprinkle over half the demerara sugar."
49,2,"Dust a clean surface and your hands with flour and gently stretch and pull the risen dough out until it’s a bit bigger than an A4 piece of paper. This next bit is pretty messy, so have a bowl of flour on hand to help you handle the dough and don’t be alarmed if it seems quite wet. Use a slotted spoon to move half the mashed blueberries on to the dough. Try not to include too much juice. Use the back of the spoon to spread the blueberries around the dough. Pull the sides of the dough up and into the middle like an envelope, and keep turning and pushing the dough together."
49,3,"Cut the dough into 8 equal portions, then pull and stretch each one into a long, thin sausage shape, twisting them around on themselves so you get a sort of rough knot. Arrange them on the tray, leaving enough room between for them to spread as they cook. Push your fingers into the top of each one to make a little well, then spoon in a few of the remaining mashed berries and gently push them down. Spoon over a little of the blueberry juice from the bowl, then sprinkle with the rest of your demerara and the reserved orange zest. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove for about 20 minutes in a warm place."
49,4,"Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Once the buns have risen, put them into the oven and cook for 25 minutes, until golden and crispy. Serve them, hot and delicious, by themselves or with warm custard."
50,0,"Separate the eggs, putting the whites into one bowl and the yolks into another. Combine the plain flour, baking powder and milk with the egg yolks and mix until it forms a smooth, thick batter. Whisk the whites with the salt until they form stiff peaks. Fold the whites into the batter – it is now ready to use. Heat a non-stick frying pan over a moderate heat."
50,1,Pour some of your batter into the pan and fry for a couple of minutes until it starts to look golden and firm. Loosen with a spatula and turn or flip the pancake over.

51,1,"Place the flour and icing sugar in the food processor. Cube and add 100g of the butter and a pinch of sea salt, then pulse until it’s the texture of breadcrumbs. Add the vanilla extract and a splash of cold water and blitz to form a dough, then pour in the ground nuts and pulse again until it comes together. Take it out, dust with flour, then wrap in clingfilm and chill for half an hour."
51,2,"Remove the pastry from the fridge and preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4. Dust the work surface with flour, and roll out the dough to 5mm thick. Drape it over a deep 25cm fluted tart tin and ease it in. Prick all over with a fork, line with clingfilm and chill for 20 minutes."

51,7,"When the filling is set but is still soft in the middle, it’s done. Take it out and allow it to cool completely."
51,8,"To make your brittle topping, grease a baking sheet, arrange the nuts on it and set aside. Place the sugar in a pan with 75ml water, and bring it to the boil. Don’t stir the caramel, just swirl it. When it’s a deep golden colour, pour it over the nuts and leave to set. "
51,9,"When the brittle is hard, break it into pieces, sprinkle it over the pie and serve."
52,0,"A few hours ahead, or even a day ahead, soak the cherries in kirsch. "

Leave for 5 minutes, then stir in the butter and beat in the egg. Pour into the flour and mix till smooth and shiny. Turn onto a floured surface and make a hollow in the centre. "
52,2,"Drain away any excess booze from the cherries before adding them. Chop and add the mixed peel and almonds, followed by the cinnamon. Knead well. After about 5 minutes the dough should be elastic, but not sticky. "
52,3,"Flour the bowl and put the dough back. Cover with a cloth and leave for 1 to 2 hours, till doubled in size."
52,4,"Empty the dough onto a floured surface and briefly knead; roll into a 36cm x 26cm rectangle. Roll the marzipan out to be the same length and place along the middle. Fold the dough over, encasing the marzipan, and place on a tray. Leave to rise until doubled. "

54,2,"Turn out the mixture onto your work surface and knead for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth. Cover the dough with an upturned bowl and leave it to rest for 20 minutes."
54,3,Set up a pasta rolling machine at one end of your work surface and lightly dust the other end with a little plain flour – you’ll need about 1 metre of space. 
54,4,Pour the sunflower oil into a large saucepan and place over a medium heat. Pop a digital thermometer into the pan and bring the oil up to 170ºC to 180ºC.
54,5,"While the oil is heating, divide the dough into three – this will make it easier to work with – then use a rolling pin to roll out each piece into a rectangle 5mm thick."
54,6,Pass one piece through the pasta machine on the widest setting (leaving the others covered with the upturned bowl until you’re ready). Fold it in half and roll it through again. 
54,7,"Reduce the setting by one notch and pass through again. Continue rolling, until you reach the thinnest setting. Keep your surface and dough dusted with flour to stop it from sticking."
54,8,Lay out the rolled dough on your work surface and use a 10cm round cutter to stamp out discs. Wrap the discs around the cannoli tube or cream horn moulds and brush the join with a dab of the reserved egg white to seal – do not brush any egg white onto the mould or the cannoli might stick.
54,9,"By now the oil should have reached 180ºC. Lower the cannoli tubes into the hot oil and fry for about 1 minute, until golden brown and crisp. "
54,10,"Use tongs to carefully remove each tube, draining any excess oil back into the pan. Leave them on kitchen paper to cool slightly, still in their moulds, then once cool enough to handle, slide them off."

59,0,"It really wouldn’t be Christmas without being offered a mince pie, would it? I decided to do a bit of reinventing on the classic mince pie, so in this recipe I’m using a combination of puff and filo pastry, both of which you can buy ready-made in the shops for extra convenience."
59,1,"Preheat the oven to 200°C/400ºF/gas 6. Scoop the mincemeat into a mixing bowl and mix in the dried berries, the clementine zest and the sherry or brandy."
59,2,"Dust a clean work surface with flour and roll out the puff pastry into a big rectangle about 20cm x 40cm and the thickness of a pound coin. Thinly spread the mincemeat over the pastry, leaving a 1cm gap around the edges. Tightly roll up the pastry, lengthways, like a Swiss roll, place it on a floured tray, and pop in the fridge to firm up."
59,3,"Take two cupcake trays (for 12 cupcakes each) and butter each one lightly with the melted butter.

63,2,"Heat the remaining sunflower oil in a medium-sized deep pan over a high heat. To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a piece of bread into the pan – if the bread floats to the surface, sizzles and turns golden, it’s about right. Reduce the heat to medium, then use a slotted spoon to carefully lower six dough balls into the hot oil. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden, cooked through and they’ve floated to the surface, turning occasionally. "

64,1,"Meanwhile, get yourself a large bowl that will fit over your pan and beat together the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Remove the vanilla pods from the pan and, little by little, add the milk and cream to the egg mixture in the bowl, whisking continuously. Add 2.5cm of hot water to your dirty pan, bring to a simmer and put the bowl on top of the pan. Cook the mixture for 5 minutes over the simmering water, stirring often, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Stir in a small handful of lavender flowers, but the trick is to be delicate – you only need a hint of its distinctive, strong flavour. "
64,2,"Remove any bubbles or froth from the mixture before dividing it between your ramekins. Stand these in a high-sided roasting tray, and fill the tray with water halfway up the ramekins. Place carefully in the preheated oven and cook for around 30 to 45 minutes or until the mixture has set but is still slightly wobbly in the centre. Allow to cool at room temperature then place in the fridge until ready."

65,0,If you’re having a nice night with mates and there’s good wine and some conversation happening then I think this is a lovely thing to bring out a few hours after dinner. 
65,1,"It’s like a sorbet, but without the work. Fiery chilled grappa, good-quality chocolate and delicious frozen grapes are a great little combo that show you care and you’ve made a bit of effort. You could either use dark chocolate or a mixture of different flavours, depending on what you fancy. "
65,2,Put your bottle of grappa and the grapes in the freezer about 2 to 3 hours before you want to serve them. Right before serving; give your bars of chocolate a good whack against the counter to break them up into large chunks. 
65,3,"Pile these chunks in the middle of a nice wooden board, arrange your frozen grapes beside them and serve with a nice little glass of grappa to sip on while you watch the grapes and chocolate disappear. So simple, but such a treat."
66,0,"In the 60s and 70s, having a frozen dessert you could serve at a moment’s notice was the posh thing to do. The simple but glorious arctic roll started popping up everywhere, from restaurants to school and hospital menus. Eventually it became seen as something a bit naff and tacky, but I think smearing a home-made sponge with quality jam, good ice cream and a little bashed-up honeycomb is easy, fun, and just a bit silly. Roll it up, freeze it for a few hours, and you’ll get sweet and sour, crunch and softness, all in one mouthful. Heaven."
66,1,"Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Move the ice cream to the fridge so it starts to soften. Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl, add the sugar, and whisk until pale, fluffy and at least doubled in size. You can do this with an electric mixer, or by hand if you’ve got the muscle. Once it’s looking good, sift in the flour and slowly fold it through with a spatula. Grease a baking tray (roughly 26 x 36cm) with butter, then line it with greaseproof paper and grease that too. Spoon half your sponge batter on to the tray, blobbing it about in different places, then sift the cocoa powder into the remaining batter and fold it in."
66,2,"Spoon the chocolatey sponge into the gaps on the tray, and use the spoon to drag it through the white sponge in S-shapes and circles until it looks beautiful and marbled. Make sure there are no gaps. Place the tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until cooked through."
66,3,"Grease another large sheet of greaseproof paper with butter and sprinkle over a few good pinches of sugar. Take the sponge out of the oven and confidently flip it over on to the paper. Peel and discard the top piece of paper, then, while the sponge is still warm and flexible, loosely roll it up into a long sausage, including the paper, and leave it to cool for around 20 minutes."
66,4,"Once cooled, gently unroll the sponge and spread over half of the jam. Take big dessert spoons of your soft ice cream and randomly distribute them over the sponge, leaving the last 5 or 6cm at one end free of filling so that it creates a seal when you roll it up. Put whatever you don’t use back in the freezer. Dollop over teaspoons of the remaining jam, then sprinkle your bashed-up chocolate bar all over. Use a spatula to smear everything into a fairly smooth dense layer."
66,5,"Confidently, start rolling the sponge up again, making sure there's no paper inside it. If the filling starts to slip out, just push it back in. Twisting the ends and squeezing it into a long, fairly even ice-cream sausage. Pop it into the freezer for 3 hours, and take it out around 5 to 10 minutes before you want to use it so it thaws enough to slice. Unwrap your arctic roll, take a slice out of each end to expose the frozen insides, and serve with fresh summer fruits tossed in lemon juice and a pinch of sugar, or any edible flowers if you have them."
67,0,"Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Grease a 20cm square cake tin with the margarine, then line the bottom with greaseproof paper and dust the sides with gluten-free flour."

93,10,"To finish, level each sponge with a knife to make them flat, if needed, then halve each one horizontally, so you have eight thin sponges. Set aside the flattest one for the top.  "
93,11,Put one sponge on a cake stand and spread with curd. Repeat with all but the top sponge and 150g of curd. Add the last sponge and spread a bit of buttercream all over the outside of the cake. Chill for 10–15 minutes.
93,12,"Keep building up the layers of buttercream two to three more times, chilling in between, until you have a firm, clean finish."
93,13,"To serve, warm the remaining curd very slightly, until just pourable. Spoon small amounts around the edge of the cake, so it drips down the sides. Arrange meringue drops on the cake, then top with the lemon confit."
94,0,"This delicious breakfast is super simple, but it’s beautiful, tasty, and the action of bruising and grating brings out all the natural sugars in the fruit, creating a wonderful juicy dressing."

94,8,Hold the nectarine in your hands and twist until you can pull the two halves apart. 
94,9,Pull out and discard the stone from the centre – you can use a teaspoon to help you scoop it out. 
94,10,Peel the banana.
94,11,"Place a box grater on a plate, then on the coarse side, carefully grate all of the fruit, piece by piece, in long strokes. "
94,12,"Carefully lift off the grater, leaving a lovely pile of grated fruit on the plate. "
94,13,"Carefully cut the orange in half and squeeze the juice over the fruit, using your hand to catch any pips."

95,0,Recipe by Georgina Hayden
95,1,"Place the apricot jam in a small pan with a splash of water and simmer on a low heat, then remove from heat and leave to cool a little. Using a pastry brush, brush the top of the cake with jam and arrange your fruit on top, starting with the bigger pieces, dotting the smaller fruits and nuts in and around the gaps. Finish the cake by brushing everything with a final coat of the apricot glaze to give it a lovely gloss."
96,0,Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and line a 20cm x 35cm baking tray with greaseproof paper.
96,1,"Put the shortbread, sugar and 2 teaspoons of the ground ginger into a food processor and whiz to fine crumbs. Remove 100g of the mix and keep this to one side. "
96,2,"Add the remaining teaspoon of ginger to the processor, then roughly chop and add the mixed peel and ginger, followed by the flour and baking powder. Pulse until well mixed."
96,3,"Melt the syrup, treacle and butter together in a large pan. Once melted, stir in the mixture from the food processor until thoroughly combined."
96,4,"Tip onto the baking tray and spread out evenly. Press the mixture down into the tray, using your fingers or the back of a spoon. When the mix is a flat, dense and even layer, pop the tray in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes."
96,5,"Take the tray out of the oven and sprinkle the hot gingerbread with the reserved crumbs, pressing them down really well with a potato masher or spatula. "
96,6,"Carefully cut into good-sized pieces with a sharp knife, and leave to cool in the tray before eating."
97,0,"Put the rice, milk, 200ml of water, half the maple syrup or honey and the vanilla into a large pan. Give it a good stir, then place the pan on a very low heat. Cook gently for around 45 minutes, or until thick and creamy, stirring regularly. Loosen the rice pudding with an extra splash of milk before serving, if needed. Peel and slice the banana, then serve the rice pudding scattered with the blueberries and banana and the remaining maple syrup or honey drizzled on top.Tips & tricks: As a treat, I sometimes like to turn this into chocolate rice pudding by adding two tablespoons of quality cocoa powder in with the rest of the ingredients."
98,0,"Even though this recipe is dead easy, the results are so delicious it’s worthy of any occasion. The combination of hot juicy peaches in their own gorgeous syrup with soft yet crisp little scone-like dumplings is just amazing. You can assemble this, bake it ahead of time, then bring it back to life when you’re ready to serve it by adding a splash of water and warming it up in the oven. Best served hot, with a few spoonfuls of vanilla ice cream melting over the top."
98,1,"Preheat your oven to full whack. In an earthenware cooking dish (approx. 25cm in diameter), toss your peaches gently with the vanilla seeds, lime zest, brown sugar, orange zest and juice and grated ginger. Put the dish into the oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Cook for about 10 to 15 minutes, until the peaches have softened slightly – the time it takes will depend on their ripeness."
98,2,"Meanwhile, mix your cobbler topping. If you’re using a food processor, whiz up your pine nuts, then tip in your flour, sugar and sea salt. Cut your butter up into cubes, add to the processor and pulse until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Tip this mixture into a bowl. If working by hand, pop your pine nuts into a sandwich bag and bash them up with a rolling pin. Tip them into a bowl with the flour, sugar and a pinch of salt, then use a box grater to grate in your chilled butter. Using your fingertips, gently rub the butter into the mix until it starts to resemble fine breadcrumbs. At this point add 2 tablespoons of water to bring everything together, and when you have a firm dough put it to one side."
98,3,"Remove your dish of peaches from the oven and pour in half a glass of water. Gently mix in and scrape around the edges to make sure nothing is catching, then use a tablespoon to dollop 6 big spoonfuls of dough on top of the peaches. Return the dish to the oven for around 20 minutes. When it’s bubbling, golden on top and nearly perfect, get your ice cream out ofthe freezer."
98,4,"Make sure your gang are ready at the table and ready to eat. Dust your cobbler with icing sugar, if using, then spoon a few scoops of ice cream on top and give it a minute to let the ice cream marble into the beautiful peach syrup. Take it to the table and don’t expect much to come back!"
99,0,Preheat the oven to 200°C/400ºF/gas 6. 
99,1,"Place the hazelnuts on a baking tray and bake for 5–10 minutes, until toasted and light brown, then finely grind in a food processor. "
99,2,"Melt the butter gently in a saucepan. Brush 8 cappuccino cups, or 150ml cups or ramekins with a little of the butter, then dust them with some of the ground hazelnuts. Tap out any extra nuts and set aside with the remaining nuts and pan of butter. "
99,3,"Sieve the flour into a bowl with a pinch of salt, then carefully mix with the almonds, sugar, eggs and egg yolks, zest and milk. "
99,4,"Using a knife, scrape out the seeds from the vanilla pod. Add to the mixture, along with the set aside hazelnuts. Fold in the butter and the orange juice. Divide among the cups, then poke the pieces of chocolate into the middle of each. "
99,5,"Place the cups on a tray and bake for 15 minutes, until risen but not quite cooked through in the middle. This will make them moist and delicious! "
99,6,"Serve hot with an extra sprinkling of hazelnuts, if you like, and a blob of crème fraîche."
100,0,Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4. Grease and line the bases of 2 round 20cm cake tins. 
100,1,"In a food processor, blitz two-thirds of the nuts to powder. Cube, then cream the butter in a bowl with the sugar until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs then add the blitzed walnuts and gently stir through. "
100,2,"Fold the flour, baking powder and a pinch of sea salt through with a large metal spoon until just incorporated."
100,3,Roughly chop the rest of the walnuts and stir through the cake mixture along with the espresso. 
100,4,"Evenly divide the mixture between the cake tins and bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until lightly golden and cooked through when tested with a skewer. "

100,8,Place one of the cakes on a plate or board and spread with the coffee filling. Top with the second cake and drizzle over the icing. 
100,9,"Decorate the cake with the remaining walnuts as they are, or lightly caramelised. To do this, melt sugar over a medium heat, without stirring, then carefully toss the nuts in briefly to coat. Cool the nuts on a wire rack before using."
101,0,Place 4 dessert bowls in the freezer. When the bowls are nicely chilled remove from freezer and divide the prepared strawberries between them. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze a little juice over each bowl. Sprinkle over a pinch of lemon zest and ½ tbsp of sugar on each (or use less depending on how sweet your strawberries are). Finish with a few torn up mint leaves and a swig of Prosecco if you have some handy.
102,0,Preheat your barbecue. Beat the crème fraîche with the seeds from the vanilla pod and put to one side.
102,1,"Cut the ends off the pineapple. Sit it on a board and cut off the skin in wide strips from top to bottom, making sure you cut out any woody eyes. Thinly slice the pineapple, and dust the slices with icing sugar."
102,2,Make sure the bars of the barbecue are clean – especially if you’ve been cooking fish or meat beforehand – and drop the slices of pineapple on to it. Grill for about 30 seconds on each side then lift off with the tongs and transfer to a serving plate.
102,3,Serve scattered with mint and a generous dollop of vanilla-flavoured crème fraîche.
103,0,"Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Combine the margarine, cinnamon, ginger and orange zest in a bowl. Use a small amount to grease a medium ovenproof dish (roughly 20cm x 25cm), then spread the remaining margarine onto the bread."
103,1,"Halve the bread slices diagonally, then place roughly a third into the dish in a single layer. Roughly chop the apricots, then scatter a third into the dish along with a third of the sultanas. Cover with another layer of bread, scatter with more dried fruit, then cover with the remaining bread. Set aside, reserving the remaining dried fruit for later."
103,2,"To make the custard, halve the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape out the seeds. Add the seeds to a medium pan with the remaining custard ingredients and 400ml of water. Whisk well until smooth and combined, then place over a medium–low heat. Simmer gently for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the custard is almost boiling and coats the back of a wooden spoon, whisking continuously."

103,4,"Meanwhile, gently warm the marmalade in a pan over a low heat. Once the pudding is ready, brush over the warm marmalade, then return to the oven for a further 5 minutes, or until golden and sticky. Allow to cool slightly, then tuck in."
104,0,"My lovely nan and grandad used to run a village pub called the Plough and Snail in Paglesham in Essex. When I was a kid they used to send me and my sister, Anna-Marie, a huge box of about 200 ice lollies at the start of the summer holidays every year. "
104,1,"The ice lollies would arrive with the deliveries from the same butcher that we’ve always shared and we would keep them in the big chest freezer outside the store shed. This was great, as it meant I had a constant supply I could help myself to whenever I wanted. I was always quite popular with the local kids because of this. "
104,2,"So much so that my supplies would dwindle very quickly. So, I started to make my own lolly pops. The nice thing about them was that they weren’t full of a thousand E numbers because I would make them out of apple juice, orange juice, lemonade, pineapple juice – all sorts of stuff. Even cocktail combinations are good. I would also sneak into the pub for some cider shandy to make lolly pops!"
104,3,All you need to do to make lolly pops is buy a couple of those really cheap ice lolly sets. You can find them in most kitchen shops. Fill them up with your chosen juice and put the stick in before freezing. It’s nice to have something cold and fruity to hand in your freezer when it’s a scorcher outside.
105,0,"Put the sugar in a saucepan and add just a few tablespoons of water. Add the strawberries and turn on the heat. Cook them gently, just until they soften and start to release their sticky red juices. Take off the heat and allow to cool. "
105,1,Slice the scones in half and put 2 pieces in each bowl (1 piece for very young children). Spoon a few strawberries over the top and a dollop of ice cream alongside. 
105,2,Give each child a bowl and show them how to smush the strawberries into the ice cream and then the scone before eating.

106,4,"Transfer the tin to the oven on the baking sheet for 15 minutes. Roast the nuts for the brittle at the same time, until they are golden brown. Remove the baking paper and beads or rice. Return the pastry to the oven for 5 minutes, or until the base has cooked through. Set aside. "
106,5,"To make the filling, place the sugar and honey into a pan and set over a medium heat. Once the sugar begins to melt, swirl in circular motions to start the caramel until it’s golden. Remove from the heat and whisk in the cream and butter. Place back onto the heat and whisk until the caramel turns golden brown. Remove and pour into the tart case, then set aside."
106,6,"To make the nut brittle, line a baking tray with baking paper. Put the sugar in a pan with the thermometer and set over a medium heat. Have your roasted hazelnuts ready. "
106,7,"When the sugar starts to gently bubble at the edges, tilt the pan to ensure the sugar melts evenly. Before long (about 3 minutes) all of it will be melted. When it gets to 150°C, remove the pan from the heat and swirl in the hazelnuts (do not stir with a spoon). Quickly pour it onto the tray and leave to aside. "
106,8,"When the nut brittle is cool, chop or blitz in a processor to small pieces. Sprinkle the pieces of brittle over the top of the finished tart."
106,9,"To decorate with spun sugar, heat the sugar and glucose with 50ml water in the same pan, over a medium heat. Allow the sugar to melt, stir for even texture. Heat for 8 to 10 minutes, until 150°C, then remove and quickly place into an ice bath to stop the process and set aside."
106,10,"Take two forks and pull the sugar out, twirling the forks to make long strands into nests. Alternatively, place a piece of baking paper on your countertop. While holding a long metal spoon with one hand over the paper, pull the sugar from the pan and quickly flick it back and forth over the long spoon, allowing the sugar to form long thin strands, which you can gather. Use these to decorate the top of the tart. "
106,11,Delicious served with crème fraîche or yoghurt.
107,0,"Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Grease two 20cm sandwich tins and line the bases with greaseproof paper circles, then dust lightly with flour."

109,5,"Roll out the larger piece of pastry and press into a 23cm pie tin. Trim it so you have 2.5cm overhang and chill it in the fridge until required. Roll out the remaining disc and cut out eight long, even strips, each about 2.5cm wide."
109,6,"For the filling, toast the almonds in a dry frying pan until golden. Halve and destone the plums, quartering any larger ones. Cube the butter, then place all the ingredients in a large bowl and stir well (depending on how sweet the fruit is, you may wish to add a little extra sugar)."
109,7,"To assemble, pile the fruit mixture into the pie base. Beat the remaining egg yolk with a splash of milk, then use it to brush the edges of the pastry. "
109,8,"Arrange and weave the pastry strips in a lattice pattern on top of the pie. Bring the overhanging pastry from the pie base up and over the ends of the pastry strips, pressing down to seal, then crimp it all the way around with your fingers and thumb."

112,0,"This is the best apple pie in the world. You can’t go wrong with Bramley cooking apples, delicious blackberries and stem ginger. The cooking time can depend on how freshly picked the apples are, so the best thing is to cook them until they’re softened first. And I don’t know if you’ve noticed this, but blackberries in shops never seem to taste of anything these days unless they’ve just been picked from a local grower – so do try to get fresh ones if you can, or pick your own straight from the bush!"
112,1,"First, make your pastry dough, wrap it in cling film and rest it in the fridge for at least half an hour. Then preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Put the butter and sugar into a saucepan and, when the butter has melted, add the apples, stem ginger and a tablespoon of the ginger syrup. Slowly cook for 15 minutes with a lid on, then add the blackberries, stir and cook for 5 more minutes with the lid off."
112,2,"Meanwhile, remove your pastry from the fridge. Dust your work surface with flour, cut the pastry in half and, using a floured rolling pin, roll one of the pieces out until it’s just under 1cm thick. (Rolling the dough between two layers of greaseproof paper will also stop it sticking to your rolling pin.) Butter a shallow 26cm pie dish and line with the pastry, trimming off any excess round the edges using a sharp knife.Tip the cooled apples and blackberries into a sieve, reserving all the juices, then put the fruit into the lined pie dish so you have a mound in the middle. Spoon over half the reserved juices. Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg. Roll out the second piece of pastry, just as you did the first, and lay it over the top of the pie. Trim the edges as before and crimp them together with your fingers. Brush the top of the pie with the rest of the beaten egg, sprinkle generously with sugar and the cinnamon, and make a couple of slashes in the top of the pastry. Place the pie on a baking tray and then put it directly on the bottom of the preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes, until golden brown and crisp. To serve, slice the pie into portions and serve with a generous dollop of custard."
113,0,"Hull and finely slice 6 strawberries. Line a 35x40cm baking tray with greaseproof paper, then arrange the strawberries in six evenly spaced rows across the tray. Place the tray in a cold oven and heat it to 180°C/350°F/gas 4."
113,1,"Once the oven comes up to temperature (my oven takes about 15 minutes, but keep an eye on it), remove the tray of strawberries – you want them to be slightly dehydrated, but still vibrant and red."

113,6,"Using the greaseproof paper to help you, tightly roll up the sponge and leave it to cool completely."
113,7,"Hull and finely chop the remaining strawberries, reserving a few for decoration, and place in a bowl with the jam and elderflower cordial. Give everything a good mix and leave to macerate."

114,3,"Wipe the pan clean, add the caster sugar and very gently melt over a low heat, without stirring, for about 5 minutes, until molten. Once most of the sugar is liquid, gently swirl the pan to mix it into a smooth, golden caramel."
114,4,"Stir in the toasted oats, coating them in the caramel, then tip onto the baking tray and spread them out evenly. Leave to cool completely, then crush into small pieces, using a pestle and mortar or a food processor. You can make this a day or two ahead – just store in an airtight tin in a cool place until needed."
114,5,"For the cream, add the egg yolks to a large bowl and whisk in the sugar with an electric whisk, until very thick and creamy, for about 5 minutes."
114,6,"Bring the honey to the boil in a small pan over a medium heat, let it cool for 1 minute, then pour into the yolk mixture in a steady stream, whisking constantly. Very softly whip the cream and Drambuie together in a large bowl, then fold this into the egg mixture, followed by half of the crunchy oatmeal."
114,7,"Spoon a couple of tablespoons of the fruit compote into the base of the loaf tin, top with a third of the cream, then repeat the layers until you have used all the cream and fruit. Run the handle of a teaspoon through the mixture to ripple the fruit a little. Leave in the freezer overnight."
114,8,"Remove from the freezer 10 to 15 minutes before serving, to allow it to soften slightly, then cut into slices and serve with the rest of the crunchy oats scattered on top."
115,0,"Peel, stone and thickly dice the peaches, then place in a heatproof bowl."
115,1,"Make a sugar syrup by boiling the sugar with 300ml water for 5 minutes, then pour over the fruit (if you’re using an ice cream maker with its own cooling unit, you can do this in the well of the machine, and leave to cool before switching it on). "
115,2,"Next, add the alcohol, then the cream. "
115,3,"Let the mixture cool, then freeze according to your machine’s instructions, or freeze the mixture in trays, stirring it at least once when it’s half-frozen."
116,0,"The night before you want to bake the cake, chop the stem ginger, then place in a bowl with all the dried fruit, the orange zest and whisky. Set aside to soak."
116,1,"The next day, drain the soaked fruit (discard any whisky that hasn’t been absorbed), line a 20cm cake tin, and preheat the oven to 150ºC/gas 2."
116,2,"In a bowl, beat together the butter, sugar, flour, eggs and mixed spice with an electric whisk for 2 to 3 minutes until combined, then stir through the soaked fruit. "
116,3,Spoon half of the mixture into the tin and level the surface.
116,4,"Take a third of the marzipan, roll it out to 20cm in diameter, then place it on top of the cake mix in the tin. "
116,5,Spoon the rest of the mixture on top and level it out evenly.
116,6,"Pop it in the oven and bake for 2 hours, or until golden. Test the cake by inserting a skewer – if it comes out clean, it’s cooked (remembering there’s a layer of marzipan in the middle). If it doesn’t, bake for 10 more minutes, covering it with tin foil if it’s browning too much."
116,7,"Remove it from the oven and allow to cool in the tin for 20 minutes, then take it out and allow to cool completely on a wire rack."
116,8,"Melt the apricot jam in a pan, then brush the top of the cake with it. Roll out another third of the marzipan to 20cm in diameter, and place on top, pinching the edges to decorate."
116,9,"Take the final third of marzipan and roll out 11 balls, arranging them around the edge of the cake. "
116,10,"Brush the top with beaten egg, then pop it under a hot grill for a couple of minutes, or until the marzipan is golden."
117,0,Preheat the oven to 170ºC/gas 3. 
117,1,Split the vanilla pod lengthways and add to a pan with the creams. Heat over a low heat to just below boiling. 
117,2,"In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar, then add in the hot cream, whisking all the time to make a custard. When combined, strain through a sieve into a jug. "
117,3,"Boil a kettle of water. Divide the berries between four small ovenproof ramekins, then fill each with the custard. "
117,4,"Place the ramekins in a small roasting tray and carefully pour in hot water until it comes halfway up the sides of the dishes. Cook in the oven for 20 minutes, till the tops form a slight crust. "
117,5,"Remove from oven, cool, then cover each ramekin with clingfilm and refrigerate overnight. "
117,6,"Sprinkle a fine covering of sugar over the custards and carefully use a blowtorch to burn the top. Alternatively, place under a hot grill until the sugar bubbles – watch them carefully. "
117,7,"Allow to stand so the burnt sugar hardens, then return to the fridge and chill until needed."
118,0,"What’s mad about this is that, even though all of these spices and flavours are so pungent on their own, they actually taste like tutti frutti sweets when together. "
118,1,"You can use this sugar for so many things; from a sweetener for porridge, sprinkled over baked bananas, or to make a gorgeous Chantilly cream. It will keep for a while, so if you’re going to make it, you may as well make a batch and keep it in an airtight container."
118,2,"Whack the bay leaves, orange and lemon zest and all of your spices into a food processor and give it a good whiz. Once that’s well blended add your sugar and whiz again so you’ve got a lovely spiced sugar. Because there’s quite a bit of moistness in the zest and vanilla pod it’s a good idea to pour the sugar onto a baking tray, spread it out evenly then leave it to dry for a few hours. "
118,3,"Once the sugar is nice and dry, pass it through a sieve to catch any larger pieces of spices. Discard anything left behind in the sieve then put your sieved sugar into an airtight container, where it will keep happily for ages. "
118,4,Spiced Christmas popcorn
118,5,"Popcorn only takes a few minutes to make but it smells, sounds and tastes brilliant; it’s a great thing to have going on in your home. If you’re feeling a bit creative you can divide the popcorn between some little sandwich bags, tie them with ribbons then give them out as a bit of a Christmas treat to adults and kids. If the sugar settles on the bottom of the bag just give the bag a shake before tucking in."
118,6,"Put a few lugs of oil and your butter in a large pan over a high heat. Once the butter has melted, add the popcorn and stir well to coat the kernels. Put the lid on straight away and leave it for a few minutes. It will take a few minutes to get going so be patient. As the popcorn gets going give the pan a shake every 30 seconds or so to make sure the kernels all get popped. Put your spiced sugar in a large bowl and when the popcorn is ready add it to the bowl and quickly toss it and stir it into the sugar so the hot popcorn picks up those lovely spiced flavours."
118,7,"Serve the popcorn in a big bowl or in little bowls dotted about the house. I can honestly say, hand on heart, that this is one of the nicest popcorns I’ve ever had. It’s delicious and has to be better for you than caramels, toffees or cheap artificial sweets."
119,0,Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4.
119,1,"Bash the cardamom pods in a pestle and mortar, remove the seeds and discard the pods. Grind the seeds to a powder, then place into a bowl."
119,2,"Split the vanilla pod lengthways, scrape out the seeds and add to the bowl. Mix in the sugar, coconut, egg white, all the orange zest and half the juice."
119,3,"Halve, destone and place the plums cut-side up on a baking tray. "
119,4,Pile the coconut mixture into the holes.
119,5,"Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, till the crumble is golden and the fruit is soft. Serve with vanilla ice cream."
120,0,Halve the lemongrass lengthways and place in a small pan.
120,1,Gently heat the sugar and 400ml of water in the pan with the lemongrass over a medium-low heat until the sugar has dissolved. 
120,2,"Carefully add the peaches or apricots, and gently press a circle of greaseproof paper down on top to keep the fruit covered with liquid. "
120,3,"Cook at a very gentle simmer for 4 to 5 minutes for apricots, or 10 to 12 minutes for peaches, or until the fruit is tender, but not squishy. "
120,4,Pour into a bowl to cool.
121,0,Recipe by Ed Loftus
121,1,"This retro remake is the perfect end to a big summer feast. And what’s more, you get the hard work out of the way the day before!"
121,2,"Start your jelly the night before. Pour the prosecco into a large mixing bowl, along with the lemon juice. In a separate bowl, leave the gelatine to soak in ice-cold water. Set both aside. "
121,3,"Warm the elderflower cordial in a pan over a medium heat and, once hot, take off the heat to cool slightly. Squeeze out the excess water from the gelatine leaves and add it to the warm cordial, stirring until the leaves have completely dissolved."
121,4,Add the gelatine mixture to the prosecco and stir very gently with a spatula or large spoon until completely combined. Place the mixture in the fridge and give it another stir every 15 minutes. You want the jelly to be almost set but still liquid; this is so the fruit doesn’t float to the top when you add it.
121,5,"Reserving 100ml of the jelly, pour a quarter into a 1-litre jelly mould, then stud with a quarter each of the fruit and mint. Repeat three times. "
121,6,"Heat the reserved jelly until liquid, then pour over the top; this will create a flat base, so the jelly sits nice and flush. Set overnight in the fridge. "
121,7,"To remove the jelly, dip the mould in warm water for 30 seconds. Gently release the jelly sides with your fingers, then invert the mould onto a serving platter and give it a wiggle. "
121,8,"Decorate the jelly with flowers, if using, and extra mint leaves, then serve with lashing of cream."
122,0,"Before you start, remove the butter from the fridge and allow to come up to room temperature."
122,1,"Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Grease two springform cake tins (roughly 20cm) with butter, then line the bottom with greaseproof paper and dust the sides with gluten-free flour."
122,2,"In a bowl, beat the butter and sugar for around 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Crack in the eggs, then mix in the vanilla extract until combined. Sieve the flour, baking powder, xanthan gum and cocoa powder into the bowl, then fold through. Add the milk and stir briefly until you have a nice, smooth batter."
122,3,"Carefully divide the mixture between the cake tins, then place on the middle shelf of the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until an inserted skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool for 5 minutes, before turning the cakes out onto a wire cooling rack, then leave to cool completely while you make the icing. "
122,4,"Sieve the icing sugar and cocoa powder into a large bowl, then add the butter and beat until smooth. Stir in the cream cheese until combined. If it’s a little thick, add a splash of milk to loosen."
122,5,"Once cooled, place one of the sponges on a plate or cake stand. Carefully spread over half the butter icing. In a bowl, crush the raspberries with a fork, then scatter on top. Sandwich the second sponge on top and press down slightly, then carefully spread over the remaining icing and finish with a few shavings of chocolate."
123,0,Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. 
123,1,"Finely grate the zest of 3 of the oranges, then carefully remove the outer peel and slice across into wheel-shaped pieces, just under 1cm thick."
123,2,"Break up the dark chocolate and place in a small bowl and melt it over simmering water, stirring occasionally."
123,3,"Butter the inside of a deep 20cm metal tin or earthenware dish. Sift the flour into a clean bowl, add the almonds, half the sugar, a pinch of sea salt, the eggs, yolks, orange zest and milk. Whisk up until smooth, then add the rest of the butter to the melting chocolate. "
123,4,Scrape all the melted chocolate and butter into the batter mix and pour into the tin. 
123,5,"Break up the white chocolate and poke little pieces into the batter, then bake in the oven for 16 to 20 minutes, or until firm around the edges but sticky and gooey in the middle. This doesn’t mean it’s undercooked ... it means it’s perfect! So be careful not to overcook it or it will just be like a boring sponge."
123,6,"While it’s cooking, bring the other half of the sugar to the boil on a medium heat with 6 tablespoons of water until you have a golden caramel. Remove from the heat, squeeze in the juice from the remaining oranges and stir it in to loosen the caramel slightly. "
123,7,"Arrange the orange slices nicely on a plate, pour over the caramel and serve with the chocolate clafoutis and a bowl of crème fraîche or yoghurt (if using). Delicious."
124,0,"Begin by making the honeycomb. Generously grease a baking tray with vegetable oil. Melt the granulated sugar and golden syrup in a high-sided saucepan over a low heat. Once melted, turn up the heat a little and bubble the syrup until it turns a rich, caramel-gold colour."
124,1,Whisk in the bicarbonate of soda. The syrup will foam up – immediately pour it onto your greased baking tray. Set the tray aside and leave it to cool for 20 minutes. Slide the honeycomb off the tray and roughly chop it up.
124,2,"Line a 450g loaf tin with enough clingfilm to allow it to drape over the sides by about 7 to 8cm, smoothing the clingfilm into the tin to form a crease-free surface. Break up the dark chocolate and roughly chop the almonds. "
124,3,"Place the chocolate and margarine in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, stir together until melted and combined to a smooth and glossy finish."
124,4,"Take the bowl off the heat and stir in the chopped honeycomb, almonds, cherries and cranberries. "
124,5,"Spoon the mixture into the lined tin and level the top. Fold the overhanging clingfilm loosely over the parfait, then freeze for 1 hour. "
124,6,"Remove from the freezer and transfer the parfait to the fridge until completely set. Once you’re ready to serve, carefully lift the parfait from the tin, unwrap the clingfilm and cut into 2cm slices."
125,0,"For the custard, pour the milk and cream into a saucepan and place over a medium heat. "
125,1,"Whisk the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour together until smooth. "
125,2,"As soon as the milk mixture starts to bubble at the edges, pour it into the egg yolk mix, whisking all the time. "
125,3,"Return the mix to the saucepan and place it back over the heat. Using a spatula, stir the custard until it thickens, then remove from the heat and pour into a clean bowl. "
125,4,Cover with greaseproof paper and set aside to cool completely.
125,5,Break the sponge into chunks and layer over the base of a glass trifle dish. Splash on the sherry and let the cake soak it up. 
125,6,"Crumble three-quarters of the amaretti biscuits over the sponge, then cover with the brambles, saving the best-looking ones (about a third) for the top. Spoon the cooled custard over the top and smooth out as best you can. "
125,7,"Whip the double cream to soft peaks, then spoon it over the custard and smooth out. Decorate the trifle with the rest of the brambles, then put in the fridge for 3 hours to set. "
125,8,"Just before serving, crumble the rest of the amaretti over the trifle. "
125,9,"To serve, scoop big spoonfuls into bowls, making sure you reach the bottom, so every serving has a mix of all the layers."
126,0,Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/425°F/gas 7. Line the base of two 20cm cake tins with baking paper and lightly grease the paper and tins with oil.
126,1,Mix the rice milk and cider vinegar together and set aside. Don’t worry if it separates – you are effectively making a buttermilk that will give the cake a light texture and help to activate the raising agents.
126,2,"Put in the sugar in a large mixing bowl. Sift in the flour and cocoa powder, then add baking powder, bicarb of soda, xantham gum and salt. Mix together really well."
126,3,"Pour the oil, vanilla and the rice milk and vinegar mixture into the dry ingredients. Mix them together really well either by hand or gently using a handheld blender."
126,4,"Divide the mixture between the two prepared tins. Tap the tins on your work surface to remove any large air bubbles and place on the middle shelf in the oven. Bake for about 30 to 35 minutes (test with a skewer or sharp knife – if it comes out clean, it's cooked)."
126,5,Leave the cakes to cool in their tins for 5 minutes before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely.
126,6,"To make the icing, put the sunflower spread in a bowl. Sift in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then whisk to combine. "
126,7,Break the chocolate up into pieces in a microwave-safe bowl and cook on high in 10-second bursts until it has just melted. Mix into the icing.
126,8,Spread an even layer of icing on one of the cooled cakes and then place the other cake on top. Top the cake with the rest of the icing. Decorate with dairy-free chocolate buttons (or fresh berries if preferred).Photo by Chris Terry
127,0,Preheat the oven to 160ºC/325ºF/gas 3. Line two large baking trays with greaseproof paper.
127,1,"Toast the nuts in a large frying pan over a medium heat for a few minutes, or until golden. Leave to cool, then roughly chop."
127,2,"Sieve the icing sugar, cocoa powder and salt into a large bowl, then add the chopped nuts and vanilla paste. "
127,3,"In another bowl, separate the egg whites (save the yolks for another day), then whisk for 3 to 5 minutes, or until soft peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the dry mixture until combined."
127,4,"Scoop ½ a tablespoon of the mixture onto one of the prepared trays, then repeat with the remaining mixture, making sure you leave a rough 4cm gap between each spoonful (you may need to do this in batches if your trays aren’t big enough)."
127,5,"Place in the hot oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp on the outside, but still slightly gooey in the middle. "
127,6,Leave to cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
128,0,"I'm really excited about this tart. It’s my contribution to the evolutionary journey of the great British Bakewell tart, which was born when somebody in a pub kitchen made a mistake while making a Bakewell pudding. I’m using hazelnuts and walnuts in place of almonds to give the filling a wicked sort of praline flavour."
128,1,"For the pastry, sift the flour and half the icing sugar into a large bowl, then rub in the butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Mix in the zest of the orange, then add the beaten egg and a small splash of milk and mix together until you have a ball of dough. Don’t work it too much. Lightly flour the dough, wrap it in clingfilm, then chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. "
128,2,"After that time, roll the pastry out on a clean floured surface until it’s about 0.5cm thick. Loosely roll it around the rolling pin, then unroll it over a 25cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Ease the pastry into the tin, pushing it into the corners. Trim off any excess overhanging pastry, wrap that in clingfilm and keep for use in another recipe. Prick the base of the tart all over with a fork. Cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge for another 30 minutes."
128,3,"Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Remove the clingfilm from the chilled base, then line it with scrunched-up greaseproof paper and dried rice. Blind bake for 12 minutes, then remove the paper and rice and bake for a further 5 minutes. Meanwhile, put a large pan on a medium heat and add the cranberries, sugar and the zest and juice from 11⁄2 oranges. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer over a medium to low heat and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lovely and jammy. At this point, take the pan off the heat and leave to cool."
128,4,"Blitz the nuts for the filling in a food processor until really fine. Tip into a clean bowl, then put the butter and sugar into the food processor and whiz until pale, creamy and fluffy. Grate the zest of the lemon and orange into the food processor, then crack in the eggs, one at a time, keeping the food processor running until well mixed. Tip the blitzed nuts back into the food processor along with the flour, and blitz again to mix. Set aside."
128,5,"Spread a third of your cooled cranberry jam mixture over the base of your pastry case, then spoon over the frangipane and gently spread it out. Dot a few more blobs of cranberry jam on top, and put the rest of it aside (it will be delicious on toast and makes the perfect filling for jam tarts. Cook the tart in the hot oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until golden and set. Once cooked, leave to cool for 20 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack while you make your icing."
128,6,"Put the remaining icing sugar into a bowl, then squeeze in drops of juice from the zested orange and lemon until you have a nice thick drizzly mixture. Serve the tart drizzled with that zesty icing, and with a little dollop of cream, if you like."
129,0,Line a 23cm x 23cm baking tin with rice paper and preheat the oven to 100ºC/gas ¼.

129,3,"Finely grate the lemon zest and pick the thyme leaves, then keep aside.Add the egg whites to a mixer fitted with a balloon whisk. When the sugar reaches 130ºC, beat the whites on high speed until frothy. "
129,4,"Once the sugar reaches 143ºC, remove it from the heat and pour gradually onto the eggs. Whisk on a high speed for 8 to 10 minutes, until the eggs start to hold their shape and the mixture is firm. Turn off the mixer and stir in the nuts, zest and thyme. "
129,5,"Spoon the nougat into the lined tin, levelling the top with an oiled knife. Put another sheet of rice paper over the top, then a board, weigh it down with something heavy and leave overnight."
129,6,"The next day, remove the nougat from the tin (trim any excess paper) and slice it into fingers. Store it in an airtight container for up to 1 week."

130,2,"Add 2 tablespoons cold water to the mix, then quickly and gently work it into a dough. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. "
130,3,"Remove the pastry from the fridge. Place a large sheet of greaseproof paper in front of you, put the chilled dough on top, place another sheet on top and thinly roll out the pastry (this will stop you needing any more flour). "
130,4,"Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4, grease your pie tin well and take the fruit filling out of the fridge. Cut out 12 pastry circles, big enough for your tin and 12 star lids (if you don’t have a star cutter, just make round lids). "
130,5,"Place a round in each of the pie moulds, before filling with the fruit and topping with a lid. Brush with a little milk to help them colour. "
130,6,"Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden. Allow to cool before taking out of the tins. Once completely cooled, dust with icing sugar."

137,0,"Preheat your oven to 190˚C/375˚F/gas 5. Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour and roll out your puff pastry until it’s just over 0.5cm thick. This will be enough to cover the ovenproof frying pan you’ll be cooking the tarte Tatin in, leaving about 5cm extra around the edge. Put the pastry to one side for now. Peel your apples, then halve them horizontally and use a teaspoon to get rid of the seeds and core."
137,1,"Put the ovenproof pan on a medium heat and add the sugar, Calvados, vanilla seeds and pod. Let the sugar dissolve and cook until the mixture forms a light caramel. Just please remember never ever to touch or taste hot caramel, as it can burn really badly."
137,2,"Once the caramel looks and smells delicious – it should be a lovely chestnut brown – add your halved apples. Carefully stir everything in the pan and cook for about 5 minutes or until the apples start to soften and you get a toffee apple vibe happening. Add the cubed butter, then lay the pastry over the top. Quickly and carefully tuck the pastry down right into the edges – it’s best to use a wooden spoon so you don’t touch the caramel."
137,3,"Bake the tarte Tatin for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden, with crispy caramelly pieces bubbling up from under the edges. Take it out of the oven. To make it look like a tarte Tatin you need to turn it out, which isn't hard – but you do need to be careful with that hot caramel. So get a serving plate or board larger than your pan and put an oven glove on to protect the arm holding the board. Put the board or plate on top of the pan, then quickly, carefully and confidently turn it out. Put it to one side for a few minutes, so the caramel can cool down, then divide it up and serve with a spoonful of crème fraîche or ice cream."

142,3,"Place the jelly in the fridge for 10 to 20 minutes (this will depend on the brand; note that vege-gel jelly sets more quickly). The key to layering up the jelly is never to let the previous layer fully set. It should still be wobbly, not completely firm, or the next layer won’t stick."
142,4,"While your first layer is setting in the fridge, crack on with the next coloured jelly and pour it into your mould when the previous layer is just firm enough. "

145,0,"This pastry is perfect for making apple and other sweet pies. Even if you’ve never made pastry before, as long as you stick to the correct measurements for the ingredients and you follow the method exactly, you’ll be laughing. The one place where you can experiment is with flavouring. If you don’t fancy using lemon zest, try another dry ingredient like orange zest instead. Or a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg or cocoa powder. Vanilla seeds are great too. Just remember to be subtle and don’t go overboard with any of these flavours!"
145,1,"Try to be confident and bring the pastry together as quickly as you can – don’t knead it too much or the heat from your hands will melt the butter. A good tip is to hold your hands under cold running water beforehand to make them as cold as possible. That way you’ll end up with a delicate, flaky pastry every time."
145,2,"Sieve the flour from a height on to a clean work surface and sieve the icing sugar over the top. Using your hands, work the cubes of butter into the flour and sugar by rubbing your thumbs against your fingers until you end up with a fine, crumbly mixture. This is the point where you can spike the mixture with interesting flavours, so mix in your lemon zest."
145,3,"Add the eggs and milk to the mixture and gently work it together till you have a ball of dough. Flour it lightly. Don’t work the pastry too much at this stage or it will become elastic and chewy, not crumbly and short. Flour your work surface and place the dough on top.

150,0,"As a child I always thought that a simple fruit option for dessert was flippin' boring and it never excited me in the slightest. But I now realize it was because no one did anything remotely exciting with the fruit. This recipe, however, I would definitely have enjoyed as a kid. It's one of those combinations that just explodes in your mouth and you can't get enough of it. Once you try it, you'll never forget it."
150,1,"Buy yourself a ripe pineapple. It should smell slightly sweet and you should be able to remove the leaves quite easily. Cut both ends off and peel the skin with a knife, removing any little black bits. Then cut the pineapple into quarters and remove the slightly less tasty core, which I usually discard or suck on while preparing the rest of the dish. Finely slice your quarters, lengthways, as thin as you can. Lay out flat in one or two layers on a large plate. Don't refrigerate this – just put it to one side."
150,2,"Take the plate to the table after dinner with a pot of yoghurt that can be passed round, then return with a pestle and mortar with the sugar in it. Your family or guests will probably think you've gone mad, especially if you ignore them while you do this, but pick the mint leaves and add them to the sugar. Bash the hell out of it in the pestle and mortar at the table. You'll see the sugar change colour and it will smell fantastic. It normally takes about a minute to do if you've got a good wrist action. Sprinkle the mint sugar over the plate of pineapple – making sure you don't let anyone nick any pineapple before you sprinkle the sugar over. What a fantastic thing. If you have any leftovers, you could always make a piña colada with them."

151,7,"Transfer the batter to the prepared tin and cook on the middle shelf in the oven for 1 hour, or until cooked through. To test if it's cooked, poke a skewer into the middle – if it comes out clean, it's done, if not cook for another few minutes."

157,2,"A really nice way of using them at Christmas is to turn them into a bit of a gift by popping a stack of them in a sterilised jar, covering them completely with honey then sealing the jar with an airtight lid. They’ll be beautiful as part of a cheese platter, baked in a tart, a sticky toffee pud, or even thrown into a roasting tray with some pork or other meat for a bit of added sweetness.

161,0,"For me (and Italians would kill me for saying this), tiramisù is the coolest trifle in the world. The Venetians don’t really have many desserts, but this is a classic. It’s usually dead simple and all about the sponge, the coffee and the cream, but I think chocolate and coffee are such good friends that you’ve got to get a bit of chocolate in there. I’ve also used egg whites, which isn’t traditional, but they make it lovely and light and spread the mascarpone about so it’s not so rich."
161,1,"Put a glass bowl over a pan of gently simmering water, making sure the water doesn’t touch the base of the bowl. Put 200g of the chocolate into the bowl, keeping the remaining 50g in one piece. Add the diced butter and a pinch of salt, and leave for 5 minutes or so until melted and combined. Help it along by giving it a stir every now and then."

Use a spatula to carefully smooth it out to the edges so you’ve got a nice even layer. Put it to one side to cool."
161,3,"Separate your eggs, putting the whites into one bowl and the yolks into another. Add the sugar to the yolks with another swig of vin santo (if you’re feeling naughty!), and whisk with an electric whisk on the highest setting for about 5 minutes, or by hand, until all the sugar has dissolved and the yolks are pale and fluffy. Mix in the mascarpone and the zest of 1 orange."
161,4,"Clean and dry your whisk, and whisk the whites with a pinch of salt until they form stiff peaks – they should be a similar consistency to the yolk and mascarpone mixture, and should hold their shape when you lift the beaters from the bowl."
161,5,"Using a large metal spoon, add a spoonful of your whites to the yolk mixture and gently fold them in, then fold through the rest of the whites. Spoon and smooth this creamy mixture on top of your chocolate layer."

166,0,"It’s a bit retro, but everyone loves a toffee apple from time to time. There’s something strangely exciting about getting all sticky and messy as you eat it. These kebabs are like the strawberry equivalent of a toffee apple. Look for lovely big fruits if you can as they’ll work better. They are messy to eat, but are great fun for a party, and I’ve given you an easy sweet dip recipe to enjoy on the side. Don’t let the kids help you with this one as the caramel gets super hot. "
166,1,"If you can’t get long woody sprigs of rosemary, you can use wooden skewers instead. Strip most of the leaves off of the rosemary sprigs, leaving a 1cm nice tip at the end of each one. Finely chop the leaves from half a sprig, keep the rest for a different recipe. Divide the strawberries between the skewers, lay them on a serving board or platter and put to one side. "
166,2,"Place a pan on a medium heat. Add the sugar and 200ml of water and bring to the boil. Remember that sugar gets really hot and can burn easily so don’t be tempted to touch it.

198,1,"Personally, I like to make a sort of bruschetta with them or put them out on a platter with some nice cheese. As it’s Christmas and your kitchen is probably well-stocked, you’ll hopefully have the ingredients for the bruschetta on hand already. If not, you can always improvise with whatever you’ve got in the fridge. "

I think the combination of salty goat’s cheese with these figs and a bit of honey is absolute heaven. "
198,5,"Figs in honeyYou’ll be able to put any leftover figs to good use in all sorts of ways. A really nice way of using them at Christmas is to turn them into a bit of a gift by popping a stack of them in a sterilised jar, covering them completely with honey then sealing the jar with an airtight lid. They’ll be beautiful as part of a cheese platter, baked in a tart, a sticky toffee pud, or even thrown into a roasting tray with some pork or other meat for a bit of added sweetness. Give them to your mates when you go round to theirs for dinner. They’ll love getting something unique, especially when you explain all the different things they can do with them."

202,3,"When the fruit is tender but still holds its shape, bring the batter out of the fridge. Melt a knob of butter in a crêpe pan over a medium-high heat. Add a ladleful of batter and tip the pan to spread it around. Once bubbles form on the surface, loosen the edges of the crêpe with a palette knife or spatula before gently turning it over. Cook for another minute till golden and cooked on both sides, then transfer to a warm oven while you continue making the others. Serve with poached fruit and cream."
203,0,"I like to use the bags of frozen fruit you can easily get in the supermarket – they’re so convenient, and a bit of a staple in the Oliver household. I use unsweetened almond milk in my smoothies, but you can use regular milk, or fresh juice (but bear in mind it will be sweeter), if you prefer. You can add all sorts of delicious extras to these smoothies: vanilla is really nice in the berry smoothie, and fresh ginger is fantastic in the mango, passion fruit and mint version."
203,1,"Add all the ingredients to a blender (removing any herb stalks first), fasten the lid and whiz until nice and smooth – you might need to stop the blender and scrape down the sides to help it along. Pour into cups, then serve. At this point you could pour the mixture into ice-lolly moulds and freeze them – they’re always a big hit with my kids.Tricks & tips: For baby, serve for pudding with an extra spoon of yoghurt.

226,3,"Once the pears have cooled, scoop most of the flesh out of 4 of the halves, leaving just enough so the sides don’t collapse. "
226,4,"Chop up 4 other roasted pear halves and pop in a food processor with the scooped-out pear flesh and toasted nuts. Add the stem ginger and the rest of the cinnamon and blitz. You want a paste that’s quite textured, not totally smooth."

228,0,"There’s one really good reason to make this – chocolate! It’s what makes the world go round, especially for my girls, they’d go mad for this. "
228,1,"You can make it a few days before then just pimp it up with the accompaniments at the last minute. This is also a good one to do with the kids, as they can get involved in all the prep."
228,2,"Place the dark chocolate and a tiny pinch of salt in a heatproof bowl and sit it over a pan of gently simmering water, making sure the water doesn’t touch the base of the bowl. Leave to slowly melt, stirring occasionally. "
228,3,"Meanwhile, separate your eggs so you have the whites in one bowl and the yolks in another. Add the sugar to the bowl of yolks and beat until the sugar has dissolved and its silky and smooth. Whisk the whites with a tiny pinch of salt until they form soft peaks – you should be able to hold the bowl upside down over your head without them falling out! In a third bowl, beat the cream until slightly thick and just whipped. "
228,4,"Once the chocolate has melted, carefully lift the bowl out of the pan. Add 75ml (3 shots) of amaretto and the cocoa powder to your bowl of yolks and mix well. Tip in the cream and mix again, then fold through the melted chocolate until it’s well combined and a gorgeous colour. Finish by tipping in the egg whites, then keep folding, from the outside in in a figure-of-eight until the mix is smooth and evenly coloured. It will look a bit dodgy at first, but trust me it will come together. Spoon or ladle the mousse into a big serving bowl or divide between little glasses or cappuccino cups and pop in the fridge for an hour or two until set."
228,5,"Just before you’re ready to serve, give the mousse a lovely dusting of cocoa. Pop your dried cherries in a small pan, add a wineglass of amaretto then top with enough water to cover. Put on the heat and bring to the boil, then turn the heat off and leave to stand for a bit. This will bring the cherries back to life. Leaving them in the packet, bash up your sesame snaps in a pestle and mortar. Tip them out, and break up any larger bits that are left so its nutty with a caramelly kick and a bit of a crunch. Serve this in the mortar next to your chocolate mousse with a bowl of those beautiful cherries on the side so everyone can dig in and help themselves. It may look a bit rustic, but honestly, it’s the best chocolate mousse I’ve ever tasted!"
229,0,"This is a great dessert that is really tasty. It freshens the palate and you can make it before you need it − it keeps for about four or five days. You can make one large jelly in a tureen mould or dish, or you can do individual ones. Use any combination of fruit, but not pineapple or kiwi fruit, as the jelly won't set if you do."
229,1,"First of all, decide whether you want to make one big jelly or small individual ones. If you are making a big one, it's a good idea to line the bowl with clingfilm first. Put your ripe fruit into your mould or moulds and refrigerate. Put your gelatine leaves into a bowl with a little cold water to soak for a minute, then drain and add the gelatine back to the bowl with the cordial. Rest above a pan of water over a medium heat and stir constantly until the gelatine and cordial become a syrup. At this point you can add your sugar, stir till dissolved, then remove the bowl from the heat and let it sit at room temperature for a minute or so."
229,2,"Take your fruit and Prosecco out of the fridge. The idea being that your fruit, moulds and Prosecco are all chilled, so the bubbles stay in the jelly when it sets and they fizz in your mouth when you eat it - beautiful! Pour the Prosecco into your cordial mix, and then pour this over your fruit. Some of the fruit might rise to the top, so using your finger, just push the fruit down into the jelly mix so that it is sealed and will then keep well in the fridge. Put back into the fridge for an hour to set."
229,3,"To serve, dip your mould into a bowl of hot water to loosen the outside of the jelly, then turn it out on to a plate. Great served with a little crème fraîche but just as good on its own."

Add a pinch of salt, the flour, baking powder, walnuts, cinnamon and olive oil and whiz together until well beaten.

232,2,"Fill the paper cases with the cake mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Check to see whether they are cooked properly by sticking a wooden skewer or a knife right into one of the cakes – if it comes out clean, they’re done. If it’s a bit sticky, pop them back into the oven for a little longer. Remove from the oven and leave the cakes to cool on a wire rack."
232,3,"As soon as the muffins are in the oven, make your runny frosted topping. Place most of the clementine zest, all the lemon zest and the lemon juice in a bowl. Add the soured cream, icing sugar and vanilla seeds and mix well. Taste and have a think about it – adjust the amount of lemon juice or icing sugar to balance the sweet and sour. Put into the fridge until your cakes have cooled down, then spoon the topping on to the cakes."
232,4,"Serve on a lovely plate (or on a cake stand if you’re feeling elegant, or on a rustic slab if you’re more of a hunter-gatherer type!), with the rest of the clementine zest sprinkled over. For an interesting flavour and look, a few dried lavender flowers or rose petals are fantastic."

Spoon or crumble your leftover pudding into the bottom of each, then top with the scoop of ice cream and pour over the shot of espresso.

261,0,"At a fantastic out-of-the-way Mexican restaurant called El Metate in Gallup, New Mexico, the very sweet owner, Rebecca, taught me how to make proper Mexican tamales. To see her teaching me how to make these, watch the video here LINK. Tamales can be sweet, like these, or savoury. They are basically filled Mexican dumplings – I think they’re brilliant. The cornhusks they’re wrapped in are used throughout Mexico. If you buy corn in season it often comes in husks, but the dried husks I’m using here work a treat. You can pick them up online or at Whole Foods Market stores. Otherwise, things like greaseproof or wax paper will also do the trick."
261,1,"Soak your cornhusks in a bowl of warm water or, if you’re using greaseproof paper, cut yourself 16 pieces roughly 12cm x 20cm. In a separate bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, a pinch of sea salt, baking powder, sugar, coconut and chopped pineapple. Add the lime zest and juice and pour in 200ml of water to bring everything together. Mix well, until you’ve got a thick spoonable paste."
261,2,"Put a large pan of water on to boil – the pan needs to be big enough to fit a colander on top. Take a soaked cornhusk or piece of greaseproof paper and spoon a heaped tablespoon of your pineapple mixture into the middle of the husk or paper; if the husks are thin you might have to layer two on top of each other. Fold the sides in to cover the filling, then twist the ends and use string to tie them so they look like Christmas crackers."
261,3,"Lay your prepared tamales in a large colander or steamer, making sure they’re all in one layer and not overlapping. Cover the top of the colander with tin foil and seal it nice and tightly. If you don’t have a colander large enough you can always steam the tamales in 2 batches. Pop the colander on top of your pan of boiling water and steam for about 20 to 25 minutes. About 5 minutes before they’re due to be ready, start making your chocolate sauce."
261,4,"Gently bring the cream to the boil in a pan on a medium heat. As soon as it starts to boil, take the pan off the heat and stir in your chocolate pieces until they’re perfectly melted and combined. Add the cubes of butter and a pinch of salt and stir well until the butter is melted."
261,5,Open one of the tamales to check that it’s perfectly cooked – it should be solid and the wrapping should peel away from it easily. Take them off the heat and let them cool down slightly so they’re cool enough to handle but still warm and delicious. Lay them on a platter next to a jug of your warm chocolate sauce and let everyone get involved and unwrap their own.

271,3,"Meanwhile, make the icing. Beat the butter, icing sugar and most of the orange zest until pale and smooth, then stir in the cream cheese until just combined. "
271,4,"Once cooled, decorate the cake with the icing. Lightly crush the walnuts in a pestle and mortar and sprinkle on top. Finish with a grating of orange zest, then serve."
272,0,Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. 
272,1,"Put a 21cm-diameter frying pan with an ovenproof handle on a hob over a medium heat. Add the sugar and heat to a lovely caramel colour, stirring constantly. "
272,2,"Chop the butter into cubes, then add to the pan with the ginger and cinnamon, and stir to combine. "
272,3,"Peel and core the pears, cut into wedges, then place in the caramel and spoon over the mixture. Turn the heat down and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the pears are just tender and cooked but retain their shape. "
272,4,"Remove from the heat and cool slightly, then arrange the pears prettily in the pan. "
272,5,Roll out the pastry to about 5mm thick and cut a disc slightly bigger than your pan (about 24cm). 
272,6,"Carefully place the pastry disc on top of the pears and caramel, then carefully tuck it snugly around the outside of the pears and down into the sides of the pan. "
272,7,"Bake the pie for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and puffed up."
272,8,"Remove from the oven and leave for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge, place a large plate over the top and carefully turn the tart onto the plate. Serve with double cream."
273,0,"This is a fantastic quick recipe for those days when you don't want to spend ages knocking up a dessert. Or it can be a really good intermediate palate cleanser before your main course. It can be made with any jam you like, but blueberry jam is particularly tasty. Try strawberry or raspberry too."
273,1,"Divide your yoghurt between 4 dessert bowls or small glasses. Spoon over your blueberry jam, cover with your elderflower cordial, and top with a sprig of mint."
274,0,Melt the 100g of butter and leave it to cool.
274,1,"Crack the eggs into a bowl, add the milk and whisk to combine. Sift in the flour, baking powder and ¼ teaspoon of salt, then whisk until fully combined. Add the cooled melted butter and gradually stir it through the mixture. It’s important not to stir the mixture any more after this or your waffles may be tough."
274,2,"Place your griddle pan over a high heat, add the extra teaspoon of butter and as soon as it’s melted pour in the waffle batter and spread it around to fill the pan. You could also make smaller waffles, if you prefer – you’ll need to do 2 at a time."
274,3,"Lower the heat to medium-low and cook the waffles for around 6 minutes, or until lightly golden on the bottom. Flip over and continue to cook for around 6 minutes, until golden and cooked through. (It can be tricky to flip a whole waffle, but be bold and go for it – if it breaks, don’t worry, you can rock the rustic look.)"
274,4,"Give the waffle an extra couple of minutes on each side to crisp up, then serve them with your toppings. I like mine with bacon, egg and maple syrup, but you can serve them with berries and yoghurt, or whatever you like."
275,0,Grease the sides of a 23cm loose-bottomed cake tin and line the base with greaseproof paper. 
275,1,"In a large saucepan, melt the butter over a low heat. Blitz the biscuits in a food processor until finely ground, then stir into the butter. Press the crumbs evenly into the tin, then leave in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up."
275,2,"Halve the vanilla pod lengthways, scrape the seeds into a large bowl and whisk in the cream cheese. "
275,3,"In a separate bowl, whisk the cream to soft peaks, then fold into the cream cheese with 1 heaped teaspoon of jam. Spoon a 1cm-thick layer over the biscuit base. "
275,4,"Add 1 heaped tablespoon of jam to the rest of the mixture, and add another layer to the cheesecake. Keep doing this, adding more jam each time – so the layers get darker as you go – until you have used a whole jar of jam, leaving a 1cm gap at the top. Place the cheesecake in the fridge for 1 hour to firm up."
275,5,"Meanwhile, make the jelly. Soak the gelatine in cold water for 5 minutes, then drain. Spoon the remaining ½ jar of jam in a saucepan over a low heat along with 100ml of water and 50g of berries, and gently simmer for 3 minutes. "
275,6,"Stir in the gelatine until dissolved, then pour into a glass jug and cool for 30 minutes."
275,7,"Once cooled, pour the jelly over the cheesecake, carefully spreading over the surface. Let it sit in the fridge for 1 more hour, until the jelly is firm to the touch.  "
275,8,The cheesecake will keep in the fridge for up to 3 days – serve garnished with the remaining blackcurrants and blackberries.
276,0,Pour the coconut milk into a small pan over a low heat and heat through.
276,1,"Snap the chocolate into a bowl, add the coconut oil, then pour over the coconut milk and stir gently to combine – it’s important not to mix too quickly."
276,2,"Stir in the vanilla, then cover the bowl with clingfilm and place in the fridge to set for at least 4 hours."
276,3,"When the truffle mixture is almost set, toast the desiccated coconut in a dry frying pan over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly golden, then tip onto a plate."
276,4,"Return the pan to the heat, scatter in the nuts and toast for 2 minutes, or until golden. Leave to cool for a few minutes, then finely chop and place onto a second plate. "
276,5,Spread the cocoa powder over a third plate.
276,6,"Using a teaspoon, scoop out little balls of the truffle mixture and roll in the palm of your hands, placing them onto a tray as you go. It’s totally up to you how you decorate them – roll the balls in the toasted coconut or chopped nuts, or for a simple finish, roll them in cocoa powder."
276,7,"Return the decorated truffles to the fridge for around 10 minutes to firm up, then serve."
277,0,"For the dulce de leche, dissolve the bicarbonate of soda in 2 teaspoons of water and set aside. "
277,1,"In a large pan, combine both of the milks, the sugar and the cinnamon stick and place it over a medium heat. Simmer for 10 minutes, or until the surface is shimmering and the liquid is about to boil, stirring often."
277,2,"Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the bicarbonate of soda mixture. The milk will froth up, but return the pan to the heat and keep it briskly simmering, stirring often. This stage needs careful attention – stir to keep it from catching on the bottom, but do not reduce the heat too much."
277,3,"Keep it simmering for about 1 hour – put a timer on for every 10 minutes and keep checking it. Before long it will turn golden brown and thicken. From this point, check it every 5 minutes, stirring well as it can catch quickly. It will deepen in colour and form a syrupy consistency. Cook until it becomes a rich, deep coppery brown, syrupy thick and sweet. "
277,4,"Let it cool a little, then pour into a sterilised jar. Store in the fridge and warm it a little when you want to use it."
277,5,"Make your ice cream. Have a basin of iced water standing by, then halve the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape out the seeds. "
277,6,"Heat the cream and vanilla seeds in a pan over a medium heat until the surface just shimmers and the liquid is about to simmer, then remove from the heat."
277,7,"Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and caster sugar, stir in a little of the vanilla cream, then add the remaining cream. "
277,8,Return the mixture to the pan and stir it over a low heat until thickened and the custard coats the back of a spoon. 
277,9,Remove from the heat and set over the iced water to cool. This mixture can be made a day ahead and stored in the fridge.
277,10,"Once the custard has cooled, fold in the dulce de leche and churn in an ice cream machine or freeze in a suitable container. If you are not using an ice cream machine, stir the ice cream after a couple of hours to break up any large ice crystals. Freeze and eat within one week."
277,11,"For the fritters, combine the cinnamon and caster sugar in a bowl and set aside. "
277,12,"Sift the icing sugar into another bowl, then whisk together with the egg, flour, milk and baking powder and set aside."
277,13,"Fill a 10cm-deep wok or frying pan with the oil and place over a medium heat until the temperature reaches 180ºC. The oil is hot enough when a little of the batter sizzles and turns golden immediately. If it is too hot, the fritters will be too crunchy."
277,14,"Drop dessertspoonfuls of the mixture into the oil – they will rise and sizzle, making puffy, odd-shaped little fritters. Cook 2 to 3 at a time – don’t crowd the pan or the fritters will become soggy. "
277,15,"Using a slotted spoon, constantly turn the fritters over in the hot oil to brown for 5 minutes. Remove and drain on kitchen paper."
277,16,Roll the fritters in the cinnamon mix and serve piping hot with the dulce de leche ice cream on the side.
278,0,"Sift the cocoa powder, flour, icing sugar and a pinch of salt into a food processor. Dice the butter, then add to the mix and process until it resembles fine crumbs. "
278,1,"In a bowl, mix the egg yolk with 60ml of water and gradually pulse it into the flour mixture until you have a rough dough. "
278,2,"Place the dough on a clean surface and knead it for 30 seconds or until smooth, then flatten it into a disc. Wrap it in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. After that, roll out the dough and use it to line a 23cm pie tin. Trim the excess pastry so you’re left with 2.5cm overhang. Tuck this under, ensuring it’s level with the rim to give a raised edge, and crimp with your fingers and thumb. Prick the base with a fork and pop it in the fridge for 30 minutes."
278,3,"Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Line the pie crust with baking paper and dried baking beans, then bake for 20 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and return it to the oven for 5 minutes more. Allow the pie crust to cool, then melt the chocolate and pour it in. Leave it to set."
278,4,"For the filling, zest the orange and grate enough nutmeg for ¼ of a teaspoon. Combine in to a bowl with the remaining ingredients, then pour the mixture into the pie crust. Reduce the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 and bake the pie for 40–50 minutes, until the filling is just set (be careful not to overcook it as it can crack). When it’s cooked, let it cool, then leave the pie in the fridge to chill overnight."
278,5,"When ready to serve the pie, sprinkle the granulated sugar over the surface and caramelise it with a cook’s blowtorch."
279,0,"Sorbets are always a nice way to finish a meal if you don’t want anything too heavy. They can also be used as palate cleansers between courses. Either way, a sorbet is pretty much always made the same way – a fruit purée is mixed with a little stock syrup in the right quantity to make it freeze. It will become really shiny and soft to scoop."
279,1,"This particular recipe for pear and grappa sorbet is a wicked combo and one of my favourites, so give it a bash. It’s great served in a bowl with lovely soft fruits scattered over the top. A good-quality vodka instead of grappa would be quite interesting and, without wanting to sound like a nutcase, absinthe would be nice too, but to be honest most good supermarkets and off-licences sell grappa these days. Nardini is a particularly good brand. "
279,2,"This recipe will make enough for 6 people to have a couple of scoops each, but for 4 you can make this amount and keep the rest in the freezer for another day. I suggest you use a fairly shallow earthenware or thick porcelain dish that you can put in the freezer beforehand – this speeds up the freezing process for the sorbet. "
279,3,"Try to get really ripe pears – even the ones they sell cheaply in the market. If they’re really really ripe and soft to the touch, simply remove the skin and put the flesh into a bowl – you won’t need to cook them at all. This is how I did it in Italy when the fruit guy called Pippo at the weekly Terranuova Bracciolini market near Montevarchi gave me a whole tray of pears for free. Go and say hello and he might do the same for you!"
279,4,"First of all put the sugar and water into a pan on the hob. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Add your quartered pears and, unless they’re super soft, continue to simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, leave to one side for 5 minutes, then add the lemon juice (minus the pips) and zest. Pour everything into a food processor and whiz to a purée, then push the mixture through a coarse sieve into the dish in which you want to serve it. "
279,5,"Add the grappa, give it a good stir, and taste. The grappa shouldn’t be overbearing or too powerful – it should be subtle and should work well with the pears. However, different brands do vary in strength and flavour, so add to taste. (This isn’t an excuse to add the whole bottle, though, because if you use too much alcohol the sorbet won’t freeze.) Put the dish into the freezer and whisk it up with a fork every half-hour – you’ll see it becoming pale in colour. After a couple of hours it will be ready. The texture should be nice and scoopable. Delicious served with ventagli or other delicate crunchy biscuits. "
279,6,PS This sorbet will last in the freezer for a couple of days – after that it will crystallize.
280,0,Preheat the oven to 150°C/300°F/gas 2. 
280,1,"Place the butter, chocolate, and a small pinch of sea salt in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Sift in the cocoa powder, then allow everything to melt slowly, stirring occasionally until well mixed. "
280,2,"In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and well creamed, then add the golden syrup and soured cream. "
280,3,"Stir your chocolate mixture into this mixture, scraping all the chocolate out with a spatula. Once you've mixed it well pour it into the pastry shell. "
280,4,Bake for 40 to 45 minutes. During cooking a beautiful crust will form on top.
280,5,"Carefully remove the tart from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for at least 45 minutes, during which time the skin with crack and the filling will shrink back slightly."
281,0,"You can make the pastry by hand, or in a food processor. If making it by hand, sieve the flour and icing sugar into a large mixing bowl from a height. "
281,1,"Chop the butter into small cubes, then gently work the it into the flour and sugar with your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. "
281,2,"Beat the egg and add to the mix with the milk and gently work it together using your hands until you have a ball. Don’t work the pastry too much or it will become elastic and chewy, not crumbly and short. "
281,3,"Sprinkle some flour over the dough and a clean work surface, and pat the ball into a thick flat round. Sprinkle over a little more flour, then wrap the pastry in clingfilm and pop it into the fridge to rest for 30 minutes. "
281,4,Lightly oil the inside of a 25cm non-stick loose-bottomed tart tin. 
281,5,"Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour, then carefully roll out the pastry, turning it every so often, until you've got a circle about 0.5cm thick. "
281,6,"Roll the pastry over the rolling pin, then unroll it into the tin, making sure you push it into all the sides. "
281,7,"Trim off any extra pastry, and use it to patch any holes, then prick the base of the case all over with a fork, cover with clingfilm, and pop it into the freezer for 30 minutes. "
281,8,Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.
281,9,"Line the pastry case with a large piece of greaseproof paper, pushing it right into the sides. "
281,10,"Fill the pastry case right up to the top with uncooked rice, and bake blind for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Take the case out, carefully remove the rice (save it for baking blind another time) and greaseproof paper, and return the case to the oven to cook for a further 10 minutes, until it’s firm and almost biscuit-like. Leave to cool completely."
281,11,Finely grate most of the orange zest into a bowl and whisk with tablespoons of vanilla sugar and the cream until you get a silky mixture that forms soft peaks. 
281,12,Put half the berries into another bowl and use a fork to mash them up with the remaining tablespoon of vanilla sugar. Break up the meringue nests into rough pieces. 
281,13,"Gently fold the mushed-up berries, and the meringue pieces, into the cream. "
281,14,"Tip the cream mixture into the cooled tart case and gently shake it to help spread it out to the edges. Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread it out evenly, then sprinkle the remaining berries all over the top. "
281,15,"Finely grate over the remaining orange zest and serve right away, with a dusting of icing sugar."
282,0,"Finely grate the lemon zest into a pan, add the sugar and 250ml cold water, and warm over a low heat until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes."
282,1,"Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, returning half the lemon zest to the liquid (discarding the rest). Squeeze in the lemon juice, catching any pips in your fingers. "
282,2,"Stir well, allow to cool slightly, then chill in the freezer for around 30 minutes, before removing."
282,3,"Transfer to an ice cream machine and churn until it’s the texture of sorbet. Pop it into a plastic container and freeze for 2 hours to firm up, before serving."
283,0,"Start by making 2 greaseproof paper discs to top the puddings: place 2 teacups or ramekins upside down on greaseproof paper, draw round them, then cut out the circles, just inside the line. "
283,1,"Lightly grease one side with butter, then grease the inside of the teacups or ramekins."
283,2,"In a food processor, blitz the flour, sugar, butter and egg to make a batter. "
283,3,"Chop and add the ginger, finely grate in the orange zest, then pulse once or twice."
283,4,"Peel, core and cut the pear into 1cm chunks. "
283,5,"Pour a little golden syrup or reserved ginger syrup into the base of each cup or ramekin, then top with half the chopped pear each. "
283,6,"Divide the batter between the two, then lightly press a circle of paper on top, butter-side down."
283,7,"Cook in the microwave on full power for 4 minutes, or until it feels springy to the touch. "
283,8,"Leave to cool for a couple of minutes, then carefully turn out and enjoy with lashings of hot custard."
