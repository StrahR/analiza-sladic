In the Sinterklass season they are available in 2/3 cookie size to huge thick men and women up to 1 pound known as lovers. If molds are not available, roll dough to desired thickness and use gingerbread man cutter or other cutter shapes. They are great to make ahead around Christmas because they last a long time.\"",

If necessary, spread  or pipe a little extra icing along either side to help support it.  Take an end wall and ice both the side edges.  Spread or pipe a line of icing on the board at a right angle to the first wall, and press the end wall into position.  Repeat this process with the other two walls until they are all in position.  Leave the walls to harden together for at least two hours before putting on the roof.  Spread or pipe a thick layer of icing on top of all the walls, and fix the roof pieces in position; the roof should overlap the walls to make the eaves.  Pipe or spread a little icing along the crest of the roof to hold the two pieces firmly together.  Leave overnight to set firmly.",
